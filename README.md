# Hi there, I’m Yash Modi! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a passionate **student and developer** 🚀, currently preparing for the JEE exam to crack IIT 🎯. When I’m not solving equations or coding, I love diving into the world of technology and building awesome things! 💻

## 🌟 About Me

- 🎓 **Future IITian**
- 💻 **Tech Enthusiast & Developer**
- 🎯 **Focus**: Learning and improving every day
- 🌱 **Currently Learning**: Web Development, Firebase, and Advanced React
- 💡 **Fun Fact**: I use my highlighters and pencil stand called "Pitara" to stay organized during studies!

I discovered coding when I was in class 6 (2017). It fascinated me because it was the first time I could create something functional and helpful on my own. My journey began with **QBasic**, where I wrote simple programs, and then I transitioned to **Python**, mastering its basic concepts over two years. 

Later, I delved into **Web Development**, mastering **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** before advancing to **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**, which I continue to practice and improve upon.

In 2022, I discovered **GitHub** and began exploring its potential as a collaborative and version-control platform. Although my GitHub account isn’t highly active due to my academic commitments, I strive to share meaningful projects and contributions whenever possible. Balancing studies and coding can be challenging, but I am dedicated to improving my portfolio and honing my skills consistently.
